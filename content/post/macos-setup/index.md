This is a collection of tools I am using on my M1 Macbook Pro. Some of it is still a work in progress.

I am using the Yabai tiling window manager to replicate the setup i have on my Linux machines, Alacritty as my terminal emulator, Powerlever10k as zsh theme and more.
Still, id first start with the changes i made in the system setting to remove most of the annoying and/or useless macOS features.
