Since embarking on my journey into software development, I've found immense enjoyment in attending various open-source and hacking events such as FOSDEM, Chaos Communication Camp and Congress, just to name a few. One aspect that particularly captivated me was the plethora of talks delivered at these gatherings.
The notion of communities converging to share knowledge immediately fascinated me and elevated these conferences to one of my favorite activities.\
I decided to start cataloging the talks I've either attended or missed, with the aim of easily recommending them to friends or revisiting them myself.\
These talks are organized by event, each featuring a title, subtitle, description, speaker, date, duration, and if available, a URL of the recording. Further details are also noted for each talk, such as tags and attendance, and while they currently remain private, I may consider making them public in the future if the need arises.\
Press a button to open all the talks related to that event, press multiple buttons to append more events to the ones already open.
