# This is the structure of my blog

I will post stuff mainly because i want to document my journey in the software development world and to keep track of my projects, conferences i go to and stuff i learn. One day, with enough knowledge, patience and hard work (or by pure chance) these contents will be useful to someone.

This site is made with HUGO, a nice and easy to use static site builder.\
The theme is the Stack theme by [Jimmy Cai](https://jimmycai.com/), here is the [Github Repository](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack).
# As of right now the site contains the following posts/guides:
## My Linux userspace
A guide on all the main tools and utilities i have in my Linux setup, with the reason why. It's heavily focused on suckless and terminal-based applications.
## Thinkpad T400 mods
A collection of info on the Thinkpad T400 model and its possible mods, including: librebooting the device, installing a quad-core processor and more.\
Also contains links to various resources, such as forums and blog posts and documentations, all of which are backed up by me in case the original sources gets lost.
## Books
A collections of books related to programming, comuter science, hacking, that i plan to read of i have already read. This is mostly a personal collection i created to keep track of what i read.
## My PostmarketOS setup
A guide on my mobile linux setup using PostmarketOS as my OS and Phosh as my UI on a OnePlus 6T. Contains info on the state of the system, all the modifications i did to it, good apps for most use cases.\
## Parabola installation guide
A guide on how to install Parabola GNU/Linux-libre, a maintain a 100% free (as in: freedom) operating system distribution, with disk encryption and Open-RC.\
## Thinkpad T400 Libreboot guide
A guide on how do install Libreboot, a free and open source (libre) boot firmware based on coreboot. I created this guide because i found the offical documentation difficult to read, so i opted to create an easy to follow guide on the process.
## Talks
A list of talks that I have seen or plan to see, divided by event. Since i started by journey into software development I have always enjoyed immensely going to events and the idea of spreading knowledge through talks.\
I have seen countless amazing talks and I have decided to start keeping track of them, so you will find them based on event, with title and description, location, date, lenght and a link to the recording, if available.

The photos used in the guides are either freely available online or taken by me. When this is not the case (in my Libreboot guide there will be photos that are not mine) the original source for the picture will be credited for it.
