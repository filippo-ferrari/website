# This is the structure of my blog

I will post stuff mainly because i want to document my journey in the software development world and to keep track of my projects, conferences i go to and stuff i learn. One day, with enough knowledge, patience and hard work (or by pure chance) these contents will be useful to someone.

This site is made with HUGO, a nice and easy to use static site builder.
