      "description": "The iPhone's Lightning connector was a proprietary beast with a lot of hidden features: By sending custom SDQ commands there, it was possible to get it to expose hardware debugging features such as JTAG and UART. For a long time, this was only easily possible using either gray and black-market cables such as the Kanzi-Cable, or proprietary tools such as the Bonobo Cable. Last year, we released an open-source tool to get access to the iPhone debugging features called the Tamarin Cable - finally allowing anyone to get JTAG and UART on the iPhone for just a couple of $ in parts.\nBut then the iPhone 15 came along, and with that USB-C: All previous hardware and software tooling basically became useless, but that did not stop us from trying: We knew from the Apple Silicon macs and the work of t8012-team and the AsahiLinux project that Apple uses USB-C's VDM feature - Vendor Defined Messages - to allow access to features such as the UART console, and so chances were high that we could use something similar to get access to the hardware debugging features on the iPhone 15.\nSo we pre-ordered the iPhone 15, a couple of PCBs, a case of Club Mate and got started: And less than 48 hours after the launch we got JTAG working on the iPhone 15.\nIn this talk we will start by looking at the history of iPhone and Lightning hardware hacking, and then look at how USB-C is used for debugging on Apple Silicon devices, and what we had to do to get JTAG on the iPhone 15.\nWe will also use this talk to release the new version of the open-source Tamarin Cable firmware: Tamarin-C. A fully integrated, open-source debugging probe for the iPhone 15 and other Apple Silicon devices. Tamarin-C is also able to give access to a DFU mode that you can't access without sending VDMs.\nNote: This talk will not contain any 0days or previously unknown vulnerabilities. Production iPhones are locked, and so while we get access to some of the device's buses we can't for example access the CPU core.\nThis talk is about building tooling for future work.",

      "description": "After over two years of intense negotiations, the EU recently agreed to their Digital Identity Reform (eIDAS). In this talk we analyse the result, what safeguards we can realistically expect and how our online and offline interactions might change because of this new European Digital Identity Wallet. Other regions in the world are much further ahead in this issue and we will also try to learn from the experiences from India and Kenya. Both countries had unique strategies from civil society to fight back against the introduction of digital identity systems, focusing on interrogating their design, raising awareness, strategic litigation and civil disobedience post deployment . Lastly, this issue pops up in many countries and is actively promoted as \"Digital Public Infrastructure\" by global organisations like UNDP and the World Bank - often with little to know credence to privacy or local realities. This global trend is very worrying due to the shiny veneer hiding their dark reality of exploitation by local and foreign actors. We will showcase strategies how local actors have resisted and shaped the introduction of these systems with a combination of technical, advocacy, and interdisciplinary ally building. Our goal is to provide knowledge about how exactly these systems work, who benefits from them and what strategies could be deployed against them.",

In this talk, we'll explore how SMTP smuggling breaks the interpretation of the SMTP protocol in vulnerable server constellations worldwide, allowing some more than unwanted behavior. Sending e-mails as admin@microsoft.com to fortune 500 companies – while still passing SPF checks – will be the least of our problems! From identifying this novel technique to exploiting it in one of the most used e-mail services on the Internet, we'll dive into all the little details this attack has to offer.

Every functional programmer will tell you that writing your code using tail recursion (it doesn't matter whether you know what that is, you'll see then!) or using Haskell's \"foldl\" is \"generally faster than foldr (Terms and Conditions apply)\". But even seasoned developers often struggle explaining why and quickly resort to pointing to benchmarks or giving some vague answers around \"you need less stack\".\nIn this talk I want to introduce you to what recursion is, some of the reasons why it's computationally expensive, what tail recursion is and why it's better, and why tail call elimination makes it even more awesome. We will go through some example programs implemented in Assembly (for those who ask: I'll use x86 and maybe aarch64 examples) where we, step-by-step, transform our function from head recursive to tail recursive and then will go further by eliminating the recursive call altogether.",

It didn't see any serious hacks in its active lifetime, the ones that eventually appeared aren't completely satisfactory, and several components (such as its boot ROMs) were left untouched. In this presentation, we rectify the situation, explain how to extract the boot ROMs, and demonstrate new jailbreaks that can take over the console at an even deeper level. As a bonus, this work makes it possible to revive consoles with worn-out eMMC NAND chips.\nThis presentation will start with an introduction to the hardware of the Nintendo DSi and the history of earlier hacking attempts. This is followed by an explanation on how to extract, analyze, and exploit the boot ROMs of the console, leading to a complete defeat of the security of the system.\nThis presentation will not shy away from technical explanations involving software exploitation, fault injection, cryptography, and hardware design. We will however try to make it understandable and enjoyable to less technically-inclined audiences.",

The limits of these approaches are presently unclear, and while they work in very different ways than our minds, they pose the question whether consciousness, embodiment and motivation are necessary for achieving general intelligence. What are the differences between human (and animal) minds and the current generation of AI models?

The Speaker is a member of the Demoscene since the 1980ies and gives insights how it is now and how it was back in the days and how you can participate!\nThe term demoscene comes from the word demo, short for demonstration. In the context of the demoscene the word demo means a realtime audiovisual application which is demonstrating the capabilities of the machine it runs on.\nDemosceners (\"sceners\") are what we call the folks with too much free time that abuse their computer skills to create releases under the demoscene.\nDemosceners often use nicknames (\"nicks\" or \"handles\") to identify themselves. They also tend to hang out in so-called demogroups. Some demosceners are active members of multiple demogroups, with or without using the same nickname.\nLet's get one thing clear: the demoscene has no commercial purpose. The only thing you'll get out of the demoscene, and this only comes after investing a significant amount of your free time into it, is a few useful soft skills and a large community of computer nerd friends.\nDemoscene releases are meant to show the limits of the machines, the technical skills and artistic sensibility of the makers. There are no rules to what kind of release you can make on the demoscene. Some demos are made as technical benchmarks, others as conceptual art, most are done just for fun. It is entirely up to you to explore what you like doing and share it with other demosceners.\nDemoscene releases can be divided into certain categories:\nTrack, an audio piece, can be in an executable format, in a tracker module format or in a pre-rendered wav/mp3 format Graphics entry, drawn or rendered images with fixed resolutions and/or a restricted color palette Demo, an audiovisual real-time executable demonstration for a certain platform Intro, typically a demo with file size limitation all packed into a single executable file that includes all the assets (popular size formats are 256bytes, 512bytes, 1kb, 4kb, 8kb, 64kb) Animation, rendered graphics videos Demopack, a collection of demos in a single disk Musicdisk, a collection of demoscene tracks with an executable player interface Diskmag, a collection of texts about the demoscene with an executable graphics interface Wild entry, everything else (including live performances, videos of demos on uncommon platforms, videos about demomaking, etc) Releases typically occur at demoparties, gathering events for demosceners.",

      "description": "In December 2021, months before the world watched Russia invade Ukraine, Russia rolled out comprehensive censorship of the Tor network and related Tor protocols. Then in October 2022, the latest wave of protests in Iran saw a huge spike in Tor usage followed by a swift crackdown of the most successful techniques. Meanwhile in 2023, Turkmenistan has blocked popular CDNs like Cloudflare and Akamai, most hosting providers like Hetzner and OVH, and much more.\nOn the depressing side, the global censorship trend continues to gain momentum, with some European countries alarmingly eager to get in on it. But resignation is boring: here we are, a tiny community of activists and relay/bridge operators around the world continuing to provide safe and private internet reachability for hundreds of thousands of people who are trying to be human beings under authoritarian regimes.\nWe will walk through \\*how\\* each of these countries deployed their Tor blocks, and what changes we made to let citizens continue to reach the Tor network. Looking at each case study through a Tor lens will let us compare/contrast the censorship attempts from each country, discuss future ideas for how to make sure the bytes can keep flowing, and talk through the political impacts.",

Computers might even surpass us, creating a new exciting niche for mathematicians: understanding the mathematical advances put forward by computers. The univalent foundations program by the late Vladimir Voevodsky was an important step towards this vision. However, we aren't there yet.\nStill even the current generation of theorem provers is very exciting. It's fun to talk the computer into accepting our proofs, and invariably we learn something about our proofs in the process.\nIn this workshop, we'll cover the basics of Agda, one of the well-known proof assistants. The workshop will start as a guided tour. You belong to the target audience iff you have some experience in writing down mathematical proofs, for instance if at some point you proved Gauß's sum formula using induction. Knowledge of Haskell is beneficiary (modulo syntax, Agda is a superset of a subset of Haskell), but not required.\nYou don't need to install Agda beforehand, we will use the online version at https://agdapad.quasicoherent.io/.\nLiterature: https://plfa.github.io/\nNote to other people planning self-organized sessions: We don't actually need the full size of Saal D. A room with about 20 seats is sufficient. On Day 0, we will scout the building for alternative options.",

      "description": "In October 2022 a gamma-ray burst dubbed the 'Brightest Of All Times' smashed records. But what is that actually, a gamma-ray burst? How do we detect it? And why was the BOAT so special?\nGamma-ray bursts are the biggest explosions in our Universe since the Big Bang: In just a few seconds, they release as much energy as the Sun will radiate over its entire lifetime. Even though they occur in far-away galaxies, their emission dominates the high-energy astrophysical sky during their seconds-long duration. They come from the cataclysmic deaths of very massive stars or the mergers of two compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes. In both cases the energy is concentrated in an astrophysical jet moving at approximately the speed of light.\nIn October 2022, a once-in-a-lifetime gamma-ray burst smashed records and was dubbed the 'Brightest of All Time,' or the BOAT. In fact, it was so bright that it oversaturated the most sensitive gamma-ray burst monitors, posing a challenge for data reconstruction and analysis. But why was it so bright? And how long do we have to wait until the next one?\nUsing the BOAT as an example, we will give an introduction about the fascinating phenomena called gamma-ray bursts. From their accidental discovery during the Cold War to our still surprisingly limited understanding of their nature. The talk will revisit the state-of-the-art of theoretical modelling/interpretations (how are jets launched? what produces the gamma rays?), as well as current detector techniques (how do we catch a gamma-ray photon on Earth or in space?). Naturally, we will also discuss what we really learn from prominent, outstanding events such as the BOAT -- and the questions that still give scientists headaches.",

But did you know Neptune was discovered as the 12th planet? Or that, 80 years before Star Trek, astronomers seriously suspected a planet called Vulcan near the Sun? This talk will take you through centuries of struggling with the question: Do you even planet?!\nIn antiquity, scientists counted the 7 classical planets: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn - but their model of the universe was wrong. Two thousand years later, a new model was introduced. It was less wrong, and it brought the number of planets down to 6: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. Since then, it's been a roller coaster ride of planet discoveries and dismissals.\nIn this talk, we stagger through the smoke and mirrors of scientific history. We meet old friends like Uranus and Neptune, forgotten lovers like Ceres, Psyche and Eros, fallen celebrities like Pluto, regicidal interlopers like Eris and Makemake as well as mysterious strangers like Vulcan, Planet X and Planet Nine.\nFind out how science has been tricked by its own vanity, been hampered by too little (or too much!) imagination, and how human drama can make a soap opera out of a question as simple as: How Many Planets in Our Solar System?",

      "description": "This talk presents QEMU-iOS, an open-source emulator of legacy Apple devices. I outline the process of emulating an iPod Touch 2G, discussing the technical challenges and reverse engineering methodologies applied. The talk starts with an overview of the project's goals and then outlines the reverse engineering process, utilizing tools like Ghidra for disassembling the Apple bootloader, XNU kernel, and other binaries. Then, I describe QEMU, a popular framework for emulation, and show how essential iPod Touch peripherals such as the touchscreen, storage, and display have been implemented. Finally, this talk touches upon the implications of open-sourcing this project, its contribution to the emulation and reverse engineering landscape, and its potential for future efforts to emulate newer Apple devices.\nDuring the past decades, Apple has created iconic devices that have found a place in the hands and hearts of millions of people around the world. As many of these devices have become obsolete, the importance of preserving their digital essence has grown. The emulation of legacy devices with software allows enthusiasts and researchers to explore and interact with them long after the original hardware has ceased to be available. Emulation, therefore, allows the digital preservation of obsolete hardware, ensuring these devices are accessible to future generations.\nThis talk describes a multi-year project named QEMU-iOS that lays the groundwork for emulating legacy Apple devices. In particular, we have focussed on emulating the iPod Touch 2G using QEMU, an open-source framework for hardware emulation. Yet, even emulating an old device with a few peripherals compared to contemporary devices is challenging since the specifications and inner workings of many peripherals are proprietary and completely undocumented.\nThe talk first describes the overall project motivation, goals, and vision. Then, I will discuss the reverse engineering process where multiple undocumented peripherals of the iPod Touch have been analyzed to understand and replicate their specifications in software. A key talking point will be the working of essential peripherals, including the cryptographic engines, the LCD, the Flash memory controller, various hardware communication protocols, the touchscreen driver, and other peripherals. The talk will also detail the booting procedure of the iPod Touch, elaborating on the emulation of the iBoot bootloader, the XNU kernel, and the Springboard application in iOS. Getting the boot chain up and running required extensive debugging efforts using powerful reverse engineering tools such as Ghidra to disassemble and analyze all essential binaries in the boot procedure. After outlining the reverse engineering process, I will present the implementation of QEMU-iOS, which entails a functional emulator that boots the iOS operating system, renders the display, and responds to touches on the screen.\nThe final part of this talk will touch upon the implications of open-sourcing this project, its contribution to the broader emulation and reverse engineering landscape, and the potential it holds for future efforts in emulating other legacy Apple devices, as well as the viability of emulating newer devices with advanced peripherals such as the Neural Engine. I will also discuss existing approaches, highlight where QEMU-iOS differs, and summarize the lessons learned while emulating these devices.\nThis talk is designed for a wide range of people, whether you are new to reverse engineering and emulation or have experience in these fields. The goal is to explain the technical challenges faced during this project in a way that's easy for beginners to understand while also providing more in-depth insights I discovered while working on QEMU-iOS. Through this talk, the aim is not only to share the technical knowledge gained from this project but also to explore the merits of emulation and reverse engineering to keep old devices alive.",

Based on the Rap Battle format, Prompt Battle is a game show in which people compete against each other with the performative use of language. AI-supported text-to-image software enables the candidates to generate complex photos, images, and illustrations, seemingly out of thin air, by typing in image descriptions, so-called prompts. The audience will decide who will elicit the most surprising, disturbing or beautiful images from the latent space, and who will walk away carrying the prestigious title Prompt Battle Winner. \nThe Prompt Battle is a game show format with audience involvement that questions the meaning of prompt engineering in a playful and critical way. Based on the format of the Rap Battle, eight candidates compete against each other under time pressure on stage in a tournament to solve image and text tasks set for them. The audience decides who has won after each round. The rounds are interrupted by video interludes that illuminate the implications of text-to-image tools from different perspectives. The aim of the Prompt Battle is to address the numerous controversial questions that tools such as DALL·E, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney raise for professional creatives. Questions about the origin of training data, the value of creative work, the inflation of images, and the intellectual property of the content produced.\nSince 2022, rapid technological advances in the field of AI-generated content have raised a series of fundamental questions. For artists and designers, the first question is whether creativity can really be automated, and whether prompt engineering really is the future-proof key capability that some believe it to be. Behind the hype, far-reaching ethical, economic, copyright and aesthetic challenges and contradictions are emerging. The Prompt Battle uses the game show format to address these questions in a playful way by confronting the candidates and the audience with prompt engineering tasks tailored to the occasion.\nThe original Prompt Battle was developed at HTW Dresden by Sebastian Schmieg, Florian A. Schmidt, Bernadette Geiger, Robert Hellwig, Emily Krause, Levi Stein, Lina Schwarzenberg and Ella Zickerick.",

How does a satellite stay safe during launch and what happens after they leave their final home, right before starting their mission in orbit? The answer is revealed during this talk. PICOBUS, developed by the Libre Space Foundation, is an 8p PocketQube satellite deployer. It's a groundbreaking open-source deployer capable of storing and deploying up to 8 PocketQube Units while in orbit. The first PICOBUS deployer was manufactured to fly onboard the maiden flight of Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket, carrying two sets of QUBIK satellites, which are our very own open-source PocketQube satellites. The first launch faced a setback with an explosion shortly after liftoff, posing a threat to our deployer and satellites. However, an interesting turn of events followed! This will be discussed during this talk.",

I'll cover the work I've been doing to improve Qualcomm support in upstream U-Boot, and how we can drastically lower the barrier of entry for distro support on Qualcomm phones.Lastly, I'll go over the new process for porting a Qualcomm SoC to U-Boot, and demo booting Linux with EFI runtime support on a Qualcomm phone.I'll also give a sneak peak at what would be possible if we had greater ownership of our devices.",
